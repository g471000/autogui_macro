# autogui_macro

I created this project for my Aunt, Kim.
She did not have any streaming service, and only used shazam. She created Shazam library with more than 1K songs. She did not want to pay for the streaming service, so she was listening only 1 minute of the songs. Oh no!

So I decided to spend this Saturday to create a python auto project using pyautogui to get all the shazamlibrary list of her, and search all the musics from YouTube Music and save them to her own playlsit. Now, she will be able to listen full songs (even though she needs to listen some ads. I am planning to puchase streaming service for her eventually)

Anyway, I think this project only will work for my case, but will be able to see the syntax.
